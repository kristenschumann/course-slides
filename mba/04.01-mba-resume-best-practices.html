You may think your resume is already in great shape from job applications, but your MBA resume needs a different approach. It is never perfect, and you are never done working on it.

          1:00 - 2:15 | Your MBA resume should be different from your job resume. If you are applying for investment banking, you highlight deal experience and finance buzzwords. But for business school, your resume should be practically void of industry-specific jargon. Admissions committees care about leadership and impact. They want to know why the CEO cared about your work. Engineers get into business school by proving they see the broader vision, not by proving they are the best engineer. Adcoms do not care that you improved ML model processing time by 150 percent. They want to know your improvements saved the business 5 million dollars. Translate technical accomplishments into business results.

          2:15 - 3:45 | We recommend four sections. Education: include GPA, scholarships, awards, and campus involvement. This is not just academics. Highlight clubs, organizations, and events to show you will be an active community member. Experience: the core of your resume, at least a quarter of the page. Go reverse chronological. Focus on results and impact, not responsibilities. Service and Leadership: volunteer work, community projects, nonprofit roles. Schools like HBS say "educate leaders who make a difference in the world." This section shows that side of you. Skills and Interests: add personality. Mention achievements over labels. "5x Superior Cello Music Award" is stronger than "cello player for 10 years."

These describe tasks, not results. On the right, strong versions. Won a 65K grant by pitching to investors for a program with less than 2 percent acceptance. Led a team of 5 to source over 10K in product and build a 2,000-person pre-order list. Increased pill compliance from 55 percent to 95 percent through patented technology. The difference: specific numbers, strong action verbs, and clear impact. You do not need to write about tasks and responsibilities. Write about results.

          7:45 - 9:00 | Key formatting rules. One page maximum, no exceptions. This does not mean filling the page with filler. Every bullet and every word should be intentional. Consistent formatting throughout, same font, spacing, and bullet style. Reverse chronological order within each section. And no objective statements or professional summaries. Let your content speak for itself. Keep the layout clean, straightforward, and easy to scan. Too much fancy design distracts from the content. Submit as PDF unless the school specifies otherwise.

          9:00 - 10:30 | Common mistakes to avoid. Do not use industry jargon and buzzwords. Use plain language with business impact instead. Do not list tasks and responsibilities. Quantify your results and achievements. Be thoughtful about using AI for your bullet points. Admissions committees are aware of AI-generated language patterns, and generic, overly polished language can work against you. Use AI to refine your writing if helpful, but make sure the content reflects your actual experiences. Do not inflate titles or fudge dates. Most MBA programs conduct background checks on admitted students. Inflating from associate to senior associate or hiding a gap can get your admission rescinded. And do not include a relevant coursework section. Use that space for campus involvement and leadership roles instead.

Remove details they will not care about and draw out points that relate to your career path and each specific school. Ask multiple trusted colleagues and mentors to review it. You may need slightly different versions for each application. And proofread carefully for consistent formatting. A powerful resume will ground the rest of your story in your essays and recommendations and share objective impact that would not easily fit in essay form.

          11:30 - 12:00 | Key takeaways. MBA resumes focus on leadership and impact, not technical skills or jargon. Use four sections: Education, Experience, Service and Leadership, and Skills and Interests. Write about results, not responsibilities, and quantify your impact with specific numbers. Start bullets with strong action verbs and keep each to one line. One page maximum, and every word should be intentional. Be accurate because schools verify dates, titles, and employment history. Take the time to create a thoughtful, customized, and polished MBA resume that is different from your regular corporate resume.
