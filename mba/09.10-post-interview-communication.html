          1:00 - 2:15 | A strong thank-you note has three elements. First, express gratitude. One sentence thanking them for their time. Second, reference something specific from the conversation. Did they share a story about the program? Did you discuss a particular class or club? Mention it. This separates a good note from a generic one. Third, reaffirm your enthusiasm. Close with a brief statement about your excitement for the program, ideally referencing a specific aspect you discussed.

Email is the right format. Handwritten notes arrive too late to be relevant in admissions.

          3:15 - 4:15 | Equally important is what not to include. Don't recap your entire candidacy. They just spent 30 to 60 minutes with you. Don't add new information you forgot to mention. The interview is over, and trying to squeeze in additional points feels desperate. Don't ask about your application status or next steps. The admissions team will communicate through official channels. And don't write a lengthy message. If your note is longer than a short paragraph, it's too long. Respect their time.

          6:30 - 7:45 | Here's the process. Step one: the moment you leave your interview, sit down and spend 15-20 minutes writing down everything. Questions asked, stories told, key moments, your emotional reactions. Do this before you call anyone or decompress. Your memory fades quickly. Step two: take a short break, an hour or two. Let the experience settle. Step three: review your notes, identify the highlight, and write a first draft. Write conversationally, as if telling a friend about the best part of your interview. Step four: edit once for clarity, clean up the structure, then submit. Don't over-polish. If it reads like it was written in a day, that's the point.

          7:45 - 8:45 | Admissions readers have said they can spot pre-written reflections immediately. If your reflection reads like a polished essay that could have been written before the interview, it will hurt you. They want authentic, real-time thinking. Specific moments from the conversation. Genuine self-awareness. A conversational, email-like tone. They've also said they're generous with typos and imperfect grammar. This is a 24-hour turnaround, and they don't expect perfection. Authenticity over polish, every time. No other T15 school requires a post-interview written submission. The thank-you note protocol is all you need everywhere else.

          8:45 - 9:30 | Should you connect on LinkedIn? For alumni interviewers, yes. It's a natural extension of a professional conversation. But wait at least a few hours, and always include a personalized note referencing something from your conversation. A blank request after a personal conversation feels impersonal. Never connect before the interview. Researching them beforehand is smart, but sending a request before you've met is inappropriate. For admissions staff, skip LinkedIn. A thank-you email is more appropriate. The relationship dynamic is different from an alumni conversation.

For HBS, take notes immediately after your interview because your reflection quality depends on your recall. Write the reflection authentically. It should read like a thoughtful email, not a polished essay. LinkedIn is appropriate for alumni interviewers with a personalized note. And no other T15 school requires a post-interview written submission. A thoughtful follow-up won't get you in on its own, but a careless one can quietly cost you. Close the loop with grace.
