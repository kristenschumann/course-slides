        <aside class="notes">
          0:00 - 0:30 | What is the best MBA program? If you have asked this question, you have probably ended up staring at rankings from U.S. News, Financial Times, and Bloomberg Businessweek. They all say different things. Stanford is number 1 on one list and number 4 on another. So which rankings are right? And more importantly, how much should you actually care? Let me give you a framework.

          1:00 - 2:30 | Most rankings weight some combination of starting salaries and employment rates, selectivity metrics like acceptance rates and average GMAT, academic reputation from surveys of professors and deans and recruiters, and alumni outcomes measuring long-term career success. The key insight: these weights are somewhat arbitrary. U.S. News might put 25% weight on peer assessment. Bloomberg might weight salary gains more heavily. Change the weights and the rankings shuffle. That is why Stanford can be number 1 on one list and number 4 on another. Both schools are excellent. The difference is methodology, not actual quality. Rankings are also politically contested. Some schools have submitted inaccurate data. Others have temporarily withdrawn from certain rankings. This does not mean rankings are useless, but it means you should treat any single list as one imperfect input, not gospel.

          2:30 - 3:45 | Rather than obsessing over specific ranks, think in tiers. The M7 are seven schools that are globally recognized and recruit for any industry: Harvard, Stanford, Wharton, Columbia, Booth, Kellogg, and MIT Sloan. The T15 fills out the next tier with schools like Berkeley Haas, Yale SOM, Duke Fuqua, Tuck, Michigan Ross, Darden, NYU Stern, and UCLA Anderson. These are excellent programs with strong outcomes, but may have more regional or industry-specific strengths. Beyond T15, strong programs like Texas McCombs, Indiana Kelley, UNC Kenan-Flagler, and Georgetown are great for specific goals, but brand recognition is more targeted. Also note that top international programs like INSEAD, LBS, IESE, and HEC Paris are not included in U.S. rankings but are globally competitive. Within tiers, differences are marginal. The gap between number 3 and 7 is often noise. The gap between 5 and 25 is meaningful for some career paths but not others.

          3:45 - 5:15 | Rankings matter most in prestige-conscious industries. Consulting and banking firms recruit heavily at top schools and thin out as you go down the list. International career plans benefit from globally recognized brands. If you are making a major career switch, school brand provides credibility your unrelated work experience cannot. And if you do not know exactly what you want to do, higher-ranked schools give you more optionality later. But rankings matter less than you think in other situations. If you have a specific career goal with a clear pipeline, look at specific employment data. Indiana Kelley's marketing placement rates rival schools ranked 10 spots higher. If culture and fit are your priority, that matters more for your two-year experience than a rank number. If cost is a major factor, a full scholarship at a number 20 school may beat full price at number 8. And for experienced hires with 10+ years, your resume carries more weight than your diploma.

          5:15 - 6:15 | How to use tiers in practice. Focus your range: apply across 1-2 tiers, not 4+. Scattering applications across too many tiers signals uncertainty and makes it harder to write compelling "why this school" essays. Adjust your narrative for each tier. At reach schools, explain what makes you exceptional. At safeties, explain why you are genuinely interested. Use rankings for initial filtering. They quickly identify schools worth researching further. But once you are comparing schools in the same tier, rankings are noise. Focus on fit, outcomes, and culture. And go beyond the composite number. Look at employment reports yourself. What percentage of graduates enter your target industry? What is the median salary in that specific field?

But there might be between number 7 and number 30. Think in ranges, not specific positions. Rankings change year to year based on methodology changes, employment outcomes, and reputation shifts. A school that was number 15 ten years ago might be number 8 now. Dig into the methodology. If one ranking emphasizes salary and another emphasizes research, think about which factors matter to you personally. Use rankings as a starting point for research, not the ending point for your decision.

          7:00 - 7:30 | Three myths to let go of. Number 1 is always the best for everyone. Not true. Stanford is not the best choice if you want to work on Wall Street and prefer the East Coast. Fit matters. Lower ranked means backup school. Michigan Ross is not a backup. It is a top school with specific strengths. That kind of thinking dismisses excellent programs. And rankings never change. They do. Schools rise and fall based on methodology, employment outcomes, and reputation shifts over time.

          7:30 - 8:00 | Key takeaways. Think in tiers, not specific ranks. The difference between number 4 and number 7 is noise. Rankings matter most for prestige-dependent paths like consulting and banking and for international recognition. Rankings matter less when you have specific career goals with clear industry pipelines. Look at employment reports and outcomes data directly instead of trusting composite rankings to weight things correctly. And remember, fit and culture matter. Two years is a long time to be somewhere that does not suit you. Use rankings as a starting point, not an ending point.
