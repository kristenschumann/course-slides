          0:00 - 0:30 | Your MBA application isn't just paperwork. Building relationships with schools, connecting with students, attending events, and reaching out to alumni can strengthen your application in ways that aren't immediately obvious. This is about demonstrating genuine interest and learning enough to write compelling essays.

          1:00 - 2:30 | Four reasons networking matters. First, it demonstrates genuine interest. Schools have CRM systems and track who attends sessions and visits campus. Second, it strengthens your essays. Generic "why this school" essays fail because applicants don't know enough. Real conversations give you specific stories. Third, it helps you assess fit. Better to learn about culture before you accept than after you arrive. Fourth, if you impress a current student enough, they might send an unsolicited note to admissions on your behalf. You can't ask for this, but you can earn it by being prepared and genuine.

        <aside class="notes">
          2:30 - 3:45 | Before you reach out cold to strangers, mine your existing network. College alumni who attended your target programs, colleagues with MBAs, friends of friends, professional contacts from conferences. These warm connections are more likely to respond and give candid advice. A referral from someone in your network carries more weight than cold outreach. Ask people: do you know anyone who went to this school? You'll be surprised how often the answer is yes.

          3:45 - 5:30 | LinkedIn is your most powerful tool. Search for current students by filtering for the school name and "currently attending." Target club leaders specifically, like the Consulting Club or Finance Club presidents. They're visible, engaged, and happy to talk. Also look for admissions ambassadors who have volunteered to speak with prospective students. Keep your outreach brief, specific, and personalized. Show you've done research. Make a reasonable ask. You may need to message 10 people to get 3 responses, and that's normal. But don't copy-paste the same generic message. People can tell.

          5:30 - 7:00 | Focus on learning, not extracting admissions tips. Ask what surprised them about the program. Ask what drew them to this school over others. Ask what the culture is really like beyond the marketing. Ask how students support each other. Ask what they'd do differently if they were applying now. These questions get you real insights that will make your essays specific and authentic. After each conversation, send a thank-you note. And if you're admitted, let them know.

          7:10 - 9:00 | Schools invest heavily in helping prospective students learn about their programs. Three main channels. First, events and webinars, both online and in-person. Attend the ones for schools you're serious about. Ask thoughtful questions during Q&A. Schools notice who attends and who asks good questions. Second, campus visits. If you can swing it, visit. Schedule an official tour, sit in on a class, meet a student ambassador. This is one of the highest-signal demonstrations of interest. Third, virtual engagement. Most T15 schools now offer virtual class visits, one-on-one ambassador chats, and recorded sessions. If you can't visit in person, these carry real weight. Schools track all of it.

          9:00 - 10:30 | Here's the etiquette. Do be genuine, keep calls brief at 15 to 20 minutes, prepare thoughtful questions, follow up with thanks, and reference what you learned in your essays. Don't send generic copy-paste messages, ask for admissions tips, be transactional, exaggerate your interactions, or pester people who don't respond. Admissions officers can tell the difference between "I spoke with six students and here's what they all said," which is performative, versus "My conversation with Mark changed how I think about Kellogg's team-based approach," which is genuine.

          10:30 - 12:00 | Here's where networking pays off in your application. In your "why this school" essay, instead of generic statements, you can write something like this example: referencing a specific conversation about a specific program. It's specific, it shows you did the work, and it's authentic. Use the same approach in interviews. Reference conversations about culture and community. What you learn also helps you decide where to apply, how to position yourself, and what aspects of the school to emphasize.

          12:00 - 13:15 | Start early, but don't panic if you're late. Ideally 6 to 12 months before your deadline, begin exploring schools, attending webinars, and connecting with students. At 4 to 6 months, go deeper with campus visits and meaningful conversations. In the final months, follow up, attend remaining events, and finalize your understanding. But even if you're behind, one or two genuine conversations can still improve your application significantly. Quality over quantity. Three meaningful conversations beat ten superficial ones.
