          0:00 - 0:30 | "Why do you want to attend our school?" This question appears in almost every MBA application. And most applicants give the same generic answers: great ranking, amazing network, diverse community. These essays fail when they could apply to any top school. They succeed when they could only have been written for this school, by this person.

          1:00 - 2:15 | When schools ask "why here?", they're evaluating three things. Genuine interest: have you done your homework? Do you actually understand what makes this school different? Fit: do your goals and values align with what they offer? Will you thrive in this environment and contribute to the community? Yield prediction: schools track who accepts their offers. Demonstrating genuine, informed interest signals you're not just using them as a backup. Generic essays fail on all three counts. Specific essays succeed because they show: "I understand exactly what makes you different, and here's why that matters for my specific goals."

          2:15 - 3:45 | The foundation of a strong "why this school" essay is research. Start with the basics: school website, curriculum, concentrations, special programs, employment reports. Go deeper: professor profiles, course descriptions, student blogs, information sessions, campus visits if possible. Talk to people. Nothing beats conversations with current students or recent alumni. Ask them what makes this school different and what surprised them. And take notes. When you find something specific that excites you, write it down. These details will power your essay.

          3:45 - 5:15 | Your essay should have specific, concrete connections between your goals and the school's offerings. Academics: name a specific course and explain why it matters for your goals. Clubs and activities: explain how a specific club or practicum aligns with your post-MBA plans. Community and culture: reference a conversation with a student or a specific aspect of the culture that resonates. Geography and industry connections: explain how the location gives access to your target employers. And contribution: this is often overlooked but important. Admissions wants to know what you'll bring, not just what you'll take. Notice the pattern: every point connects something specific about the school to something specific about you.

These are true but meaningless. They don't differentiate you. On the right: specific connections. A named professor whose course addresses your skill gap. A specific lab that aligns with your long-term goal. Named alumni doing what you want to do. If you can swap the school name and the essay still works, it's too generic.

Structure each point: here's something specific about this school, here's why it matters for my goals, and optionally, here's how I'll contribute.

          7:45 - 9:00 | Quick positioning tips for top schools. HBS: emphasize leadership and impact, reference the case method. Stanford: focus on personal development and authenticity, reference their mission. Wharton: highlight analytical rigor and the flexible curriculum. Booth: emphasize intellectual curiosity and freedom to create your own path. Kellogg: focus on teamwork and collaboration. MIT Sloan: highlight innovation and action-oriented learning. Important caveat: essay prompts, school priorities, and cultural emphasis evolve from year to year. Use these as starting points, but always check the current cycle's prompts and do fresh research.

          9:00 - 10:00 | Five common mistakes. First, the interchangeable essay. If you can swap the school name and it still works, it's too generic. Start over. Second, all take, no give. Focusing only on what you'll gain with nothing about what you'll contribute to the community. Third, namedropping without substance. Mentioning a professor or course without explaining why it matters for your goals. Fourth, sounding like a brochure. Don't repeat marketing copy back to the school. Add your own insight and perspective.
