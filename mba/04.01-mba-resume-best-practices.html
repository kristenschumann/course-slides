        <aside class="notes">
          0:00 - 0:30 | Your resume is the backbone of your entire application. Adcoms will reference it while reading your essays, your recommendations, everything. Now, if you are coming from engineering or a technical role, you probably think your resume is solid because it has landed you jobs before. But an MBA resume is a completely different document. 💡 I have worked with hundreds of engineers making this transition, and the resume is always where we start — because it forces you to rethink how you talk about your work.

        </div>

        <p class="text-lg text-light" style="margin-top: 24px;">Engineers get into business school by proving they see the broader vision of why their work helped the organization, not by proving they are the best engineer. Translate technical accomplishments into business results.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          1:00 - 2:15 | This is the single biggest shift I coach my clients through. When you apply for engineering roles, you lead with technical depth — frameworks, system design, performance metrics. For business school, adcoms do not care about that. They care about leadership and impact. They want to know why the CEO cared about your work. 💡 I had a client who was so proud of improving ML model processing time by 150 percent. Great engineering achievement. But I told him: the adcom does not know what that means. What they need to hear is that his improvements saved the business 5 million dollars annually. That is the translation. Every technical accomplishment has a business story behind it — my job is helping you find it.

          2:15 - 3:45 | I structure every client resume around these four sections. Education: GPA, scholarships, awards, but also campus involvement. Engineers sometimes leave this sparse — do not. Schools want to see you will be an active community member, not just a student. Experience: the heart of your resume. Reverse chronological, results-driven. This is where we spend the most time together. Service and Leadership: this is where engineers often have the thinnest section, and it matters more than you think. Schools like HBS literally say they "educate leaders who make a difference in the world." 💡 I always ask my clients to dig into volunteer work, mentoring, open source contributions, anything that shows initiative beyond your day job. Skills and Interests: this is your personality section. Achievements over labels. "5x Superior Cello Music Award" tells a story. "Cello player for 10 years" does not.

          3:50 - 5:15 | This is based on a real client — a software engineer. Look at the left column first. "Pitched product to investors." "Managed inventory." "Helped patients take pills." These read like a job description, not an achievement list. 💡 When this client first sent me their resume, every bullet started with a task. We rewrote every single one. On the right: won a 65K grant in a program with less than 2 percent acceptance. Led a team of 5 to build a 2,000-person pre-order list. Increased pill compliance from 55 to 95 percent. Same person, same experiences — completely different story. The pattern I teach: strong action verb, specific number, clear business impact. Engineers love data, so use it. Quantify everything.

          5:15 - 6:30 | Here is another client example, a business analyst this time. "Part of group that made customer segmentation model" — I see this kind of language constantly. Passive, vague, hiding behind the team. 💡 One of the most common mistakes I catch is engineers downplaying their own role. You built the model. Say that. The rewrite: redesigned Fortune 500 support strategy by building a segmentation model for 10 customer groups. Led two airlines in social media strategy by surveying over 1,000 complaints. Saved 100K through a staffing strategy. Notice every bullet starts with what YOU did and what it achieved. At least two bullets per position. Cut anything that does not show impact.

          6:30 - 7:45 | This is my framework for positioning candidates, and it shapes how I approach every resume. School-specific fit: each school has its own DNA. Wharton values finance and analytics differently than Stanford values entrepreneurship. Your resume should reflect that. I help clients create targeted versions. High-potential path: if you are at Google, McKinsey, or Goldman, you check this box — but so does everyone else. The risk for technical professionals is blending in. Your unique story and outside interests are what differentiate you. Diverse background: this is where many of my engineer clients actually have an advantage. Non-traditional paths bring fresh perspective, but you have to prove you are grounded and realistic about what business school will do for you. 💡 I often help clients figure out which profile fits them best, and sometimes it is a combination.

          7:45 - 9:00 | Formatting seems basic, but 💡 I catch these mistakes constantly. One page maximum, no exceptions. Engineers sometimes want to list every project and technology — resist that urge. Every word earns its spot. Consistent formatting throughout. Same font, same spacing, same bullet style. Adcoms read hundreds of resumes; inconsistency signals carelessness. Reverse chronological within each section. And no objective statements or professional summaries — they waste prime real estate. Keep the layout clean and scannable. No fancy design. Submit as PDF unless the school says otherwise.

          9:00 - 10:30 | These are the mistakes I see over and over. Industry jargon is the number one problem with technical resumes. If an adcom has to Google what you did, you have lost them. Translate to plain language with business impact. 💡 I had a client whose entire resume was Kubernetes, microservices, CI/CD pipelines — we rewrote every bullet to focus on the business outcomes those systems enabled. Listing tasks instead of results — we covered this, but it bears repeating. Quantify everything. AI-generated bullets are a growing issue. Adcoms can spot that polished-but-generic ChatGPT language. Use AI to refine, but the details must be yours. Inflated titles or fudged dates — do not even think about it. Schools run background checks on admitted students. I have seen offers rescinded. And skip the relevant coursework section. Use that space for leadership and involvement instead.

          10:30 - 11:30 | My final review process with clients always starts the same way: read your resume pretending you know nothing about engineering. If a bullet only makes sense to someone in your field, rewrite it. Remove anything that does not serve your MBA narrative and amplify what connects to your target school. Get outside eyes on it — not just engineers, but people in business, in admissions, anyone who can tell you if your impact is coming through. You will likely need slightly different versions for each school. 💡 Think of your resume as the foundation that your essays and recommendations build on. It is the objective proof of impact that would not fit naturally in essay form.

          11:30 - 12:00 | To wrap up. Your MBA resume is not your engineering resume with a new header. It is a strategic document that translates your technical career into leadership and impact language. Four sections: Education, Experience, Service and Leadership, Skills and Interests. Results over responsibilities — quantify everything. Strong action verbs, one line per bullet. One page, every word intentional. And be accurate, because schools verify. The engineers I work with who get into top programs are the ones who embrace this translation. They do not hide their technical background — they reframe it to show they are ready to lead beyond engineering.
