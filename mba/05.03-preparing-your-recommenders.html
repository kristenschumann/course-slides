          0:00 - 0:30 | Supporting your recommenders is a critical part of the recommendation process. It often makes all the difference between a mediocre, last-minute recommendation and a thoughtful, rockstar recommendation. These are busy people. If you do the heavy lifting for them, they will reward you with a high-quality, on-time letter.

          1:00 - 2:00 | Before we get into how to prepare them, let's address the biggest pitfall: writing the letter yourself. Do everything you can to avoid this. Letters written by applicants are weaker for two reasons. First, it's awkward to brag about yourself and put someone else's name on it. Second, you lose the recommender's unique perspective and voice. Instead, use a recommender prep document. It still requires significant effort, but it makes their job much easier and ensures a better result. If you don't provide help, recommenders often feel overwhelmed about where to start and may ask you to write it for them.

          2:00 - 3:15 | Your prep document should have three sections. First, an overview: the schools you're applying to, application deadlines, what strong recommendations look like, and what makes these programs selective. This helps your recommender understand the stakes and caliber required. Second, your narrative and themes: your career goals, the 2-3 themes you're emphasizing in your application, and how you want to be positioned. This ensures their letter reinforces rather than contradicts your story. Third, question-by-question guidance: walk them through each type of question with specific stories and examples they can draw from. This document lets you control and guide their writing while still allowing them to be creative with their words.

          3:20 - 4:30 | There are five main prompt types. History: a brief question about how they know you, typically limited to a short answer. Comparison: how you compare to peers. This is the most important prompt with the largest word count. Criticism: what constructive feedback they've given you and how you responded. Behavioral: tell us about a time when, requiring specific stories. And optional: anything else we should know. Let's look at how to support each one.

          4:30 - 5:45 | The comparison prompt is the most important. Nine of the top ten programs ask it. Here is the pattern that works: make a bold claim about the applicant, then back it up with a specific story and examples. You can repeat this pattern 2-3 times. We don't recommend more than 3-4 stories because there won't be enough room to properly explain them. In your prep doc, think about specific praise this person has given you, especially any compliment that compared you to others. Offer at least one strong story per claim, with concrete details and numbers. This prompt usually has the largest word count, so set your recommender up to fill that space.

          5:45 - 7:30 | The criticism prompt can be uncomfortable because it requires vulnerability. But for admissions committees, these can be the most moving parts of the entire application. Think of times you received criticism from your recommender, write down what you did afterward, and choose the one where you showed the most growth. For behavioral prompts, use the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result. Spend extra time on the Action portion and include numbers in the Result. Here's a big secret: almost every recommender prompt is a behavioral question in disguise. The strongest answers always include a powerful story. For the optional prompt, only use it for genuine clarifying information like personal circumstances. If there's nothing to add, suggest they leave it blank. Don't treat it as extra bragging space.

          7:30 - 9:00 | Once your prep document is finished, set up a 30-45 minute meeting. First, thank them again for agreeing to help. Second, explain your overall narrative and career goals. Third, go through each question they'll be asked and share the stories and examples you've suggested. Fourth, ask if anything is missing or if they have better stories. This accomplishes several things. Your recommender feels supported, not abandoned. You can clarify anything confusing. They may remember stories you forgot. And it shows you're taking this seriously. This meeting gets you involved from the very beginning.

          9:00 - 10:30 | Sometimes a recommender will ask you to write the letter for them. Do your best to avoid this, but if they insist after receiving the prep document, here are guidelines. Don't feel guilty. It's not immoral as long as you don't fabricate anything and they approve the final version. Study their writing style by reading old emails or publications. Match their tone, whether serious, lighthearted, or humorous. Be bolder than you think. You will almost certainly undersell yourself when writing your own recommendation. Get out of your own head and make yourself look good. Finally, get a second opinion from someone who knows you both. Ask them what parts sound like the recommender and what parts sound like you.
