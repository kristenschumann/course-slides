Be credible: every claim supported by evidence. Be relevant: aligned with what schools value. Be memorable: easy to recall, creates a lasting impression. Before you submit, ask yourself whether your application meets all four.

          3:40 - 5:15 | Four steps. First, know the stereotypes. What do admissions officers assume about consultants, bankers, or engineers? Know them so you can transcend them. Second, compare yourself to peers. What have you done that they have not? What perspectives do you bring that they do not? Third, look for combinations. Banker plus musician. Engineer plus nonprofit founder. The intersection of two things creates uniqueness. Fourth, dig into your why. Link your experiences with a thoughtful, personal reason. This requires deep reflection. Your why is often more differentiating than your what.

          5:15 - 6:30 | Every applicant pool has patterns. Here is how to stand out within common backgrounds. Consultants: go beyond leadership and analytics. Show a personal passion, unique industry focus, or entrepreneurial side. Bankers: move past drive and quantitative skills. Highlight social impact or creative pursuits. Tech applicants: complement innovation with people leadership and business impact. Military: balance leadership and discipline with vulnerability and your creative side. Nonprofit: pair mission with business rigor and scalability thinking. The consultant who started a nonprofit is memorable. The banker who was a Division 1 athlete gets remembered.

        <p class="text-sm text-light" style="margin-top: 24px;">Don't manufacture a spike. If you don't have something genuinely standout, focus on being strong across the board with an authentic story.</p>

          7:30 - 8:45 | Where do you look for your spike? Quantifiable impact, like building a team from 3 to 30 people. Unique experience, something few people have worked on. Recognition, like an award, fellowship, or publication. Or a distinctive skill, like speaking four languages fluently. Your spike does not have to be dramatic. It could be growing revenue at a family restaurant from 200K to 800K or publishing peer-reviewed research. Look for where your impact is quantifiable and your commitment is undeniable. But do not manufacture a spike. If you do not have something genuinely standout, focus on being strong across the board with an authentic story. A fake spike is worse than no spike.

        <aside class="notes">
          8:45 - 9:30 | Before you finalize, ask three questions. First, the one-phrase test: what one phrase would an admissions officer use to describe you? If you cannot answer this, your positioning is not clear enough. Second, the uniqueness test: could another applicant from your background submit the same essays? If yes, you have not differentiated enough. Third, the spike test: does your spike come through in at least one essay and one recommendation? If not, it is a footnote, not a spike. Your positioning should combine your narrative themes, your differentiation within your category, and authenticity. The goal is not to become someone you are not. It is to help admissions see the full, unique picture of who you already are.

Apply brand positioning principles: be distinctive, credible, relevant, and memorable. Identify the common positioning for your background and then go beyond it. Develop a spike, one standout thing that makes you memorable in committee. And stay authentic. You do not need extraordinary experiences. Thoughtful framing of your experiences matters more than the raw facts.
