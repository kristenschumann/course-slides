          0:00 - 0:30 | Wharton does interviews differently. Instead of a traditional one-on-one, you participate in a Team-Based Discussion, a group activity with other applicants. This freaks people out. How do you stand out without being aggressive? How do you collaborate with people you're competing against? It's more manageable than it sounds. Let me show you how to prepare.

          1:00 - 2:30 | Here's how the TBD works. You're placed in a group of about 5-6 other applicants. You're given a business-related prompt, typically a case or discussion question. The group has about 35 minutes to discuss and reach some form of conclusion. A Wharton admissions team member observes and takes notes but doesn't participate. The prompt is revealed at the start and everyone gets the same information. There's no single right answer. The discussion is the point. The TBD may be in person or virtual. Check your invitation for specifics. If virtual, look at the camera when speaking and use participant names.

Critical thinking: do you have substantive ideas and consider multiple perspectives? Awareness: are you reading the room?

          4:05 - 6:00 | Seven strategies. First, contribute early but not necessarily first. Get into the conversation before anxiety makes it harder. Second, build on others' ideas. Reference what someone said and extend it. This shows you're listening. Third, invite others in. If someone hasn't spoken, create space for them. This is leadership without domination. Fourth, suggest structure when the group is floundering. Fifth, synthesize and summarize periodically to move the conversation forward. Sixth, disagree respectfully when you have a different view. Constructive disagreement shows critical thinking. Seventh, don't fight for airtime. If several people want to talk, let others go. You'll have chances.

This backfires because it shows you'd be a difficult classmate. Staying silent: getting intimidated and barely speaking. You have to contribute, so prepare yourself to jump in early. Ignoring others: waiting for your turn to talk without engaging with what's been said. Also avoid treating it as a debate where you try to prove others wrong, and don't get stuck on one point if the group has moved past it.

          7:30 - 8:15 | Here's the question behind the entire TBD: would I want to learn with this person? Would they make a study group better? Everything you do in the discussion should answer yes. Collaborate genuinely. Communicate clearly. Show awareness of the room. This is not about individual brilliance or having the right answer. It's about being someone who makes the group smarter and more productive.

          8:15 - 9:30 | Four steps to prepare. First, practice with groups. Find other Wharton applicants or friends and do mock TBDs. Practice the collaborative dynamics, not just your ideas. Second, study common prompt types: resource allocation problems, ethical dilemmas, and strategic decisions. For each, know how to identify the core tension and suggest evaluation criteria. Third, build a flexible toolkit of discussion frameworks you can apply without forcing them. Fourth, manage your nerves. The group setting is anxiety-inducing, but remember that everyone is nervous. A calm, collaborative presence stands out.

          9:30 - 10:30 | Three common prompt types. Resource allocation: how should a foundation prioritize its budget? Approach this by suggesting evaluation criteria like impact, feasibility, and urgency, then systematically apply them. Ethical dilemmas: a company faces a tension between profit and responsibility. Identify stakeholders, weigh short-term versus long-term consequences. Strategic decisions: should a company expand or deepen? Define the tradeoffs and encourage the group to consider both options before deciding. When you first read any prompt, spend your thinking time identifying the core tension, two or three criteria, and your initial position with one supporting reason.

Contribute early and consistently, but don't dominate. Invite quiet participants in and suggest structure when the group needs it. Practice with groups because this is a skill you can develop. And above all, show that you'd be a great learning partner. That's what Wharton wants to see.
