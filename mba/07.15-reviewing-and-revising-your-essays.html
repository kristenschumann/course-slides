          0:00 - 0:30 | So here's the thing — most people finish a draft and think they're basically done. Fix a few typos, tweak a sentence, submit. But the real work happens in revision. The gap between a good essay and a great one almost always comes down to how you rewrite it.

          1:00 - 2:00 | You've got a first draft — that's a big step. Now here's the thing: it's probably pretty far from what you'll eventually submit, and that's completely normal. Every strong essay goes through serious revision. This isn't about fixing typos — it's about refining your ideas, sharpening your message, and making it sound like you. [Share a time a client's essay transformed dramatically through revision — the first draft vs. what they eventually submitted.] Think of revision as one of the most important parts of the process, not just a final step.

          2:00 - 3:30 | Five techniques I actually recommend. Read aloud — your brain auto-corrects silently, but your ears won't let you get away with clunky sentences. Print it out — grab a pen, mark it up. Something about paper makes problems pop. Change the format — different font, read it on your phone, export to PDF. Tricks your brain into seeing it fresh. Read backward — paragraph by paragraph in reverse. Forces you to evaluate each one on its own instead of riding the narrative flow. And the "so what?" test — after every paragraph, ask yourself why it matters. If you can't answer quickly, that paragraph isn't doing enough work. [Which of these do you actually use with clients? Lead with your favorite.]

Pass 2 — content: is every paragraph pulling its weight? Real details or just filler? Pass 3 — flow: do transitions work? Pacing feel right? Pass 4 — voice: does this sound like you, or like an essay? Pass 5 — line editing: tighten sentences, cut filler words. Pass 6 — proofreading. And don't start proofreading until the content is locked. No point perfecting the grammar of a paragraph you might delete.

Someone with MBA experience if you can find them. And a Leland MBA coach — they know what adcoms are looking for and can give you expert-level feedback. But be specific about what you're asking. "What do you think?" gets you nothing useful. Instead: does this answer the prompt? What's the one thing you remember? Where did your attention drift? Those questions get you actionable feedback.

          6:30 - 7:45 | Three rules for using feedback well. Look for patterns — if three people flag the same thing, it's real. If one person has a concern, it might just be their taste. Protect your voice — if feedback pushes you away from what feels authentic, push back. This is your essay, not theirs. [Share an example of feedback that pushed a client away from their authentic voice — what happened and how you course-corrected.] And know when to stop. At some point, more rounds just make you second-guess yourself. If it's solid, send it.

          7:45 - 8:45 | Here's a realistic timeline. Draft it — get everything down, don't edit yet. Then wait a day or two. Revise the big picture, then share with 2-3 people. Here's the key — steps 2 and 3 aren't one-and-done. You'll probably go through them multiple times. Revise, share, get feedback, incorporate it, revise again, maybe share with another person. That loop is where essays get dramatically better. Final pass — flow, voice, line editing, proofread. This whole process takes 2-4 weeks per essay. If you're applying to multiple schools, start early.

          8:45 - 9:30 | Four traps I see all the time. Revising while drafting — kills your momentum. Write first, fix later. Asking too many people — five opinions beat fifteen. Too much feedback just creates noise. Only asking people who'll tell you it's great — you need honest readers, not cheerleaders. If nobody's pushing back, you're not getting real feedback. And skipping the break — fresh eyes are non-negotiable. Give yourself at least a day between major rounds.

          9:30 - 10:00 | To wrap up: your first draft isn't supposed to be good — give yourself permission for that. Take time between rounds. Use different passes for different levels of editing — don't try to fix everything at once. Get feedback from varied sources with specific questions, not "what do you think?" Look for patterns and protect your voice — if it doesn't sound like you, revert. And know when to stop. Perfect is the enemy of done. Revision is where good essays become great. Put in the time.
