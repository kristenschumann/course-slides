Fellowships are named awards that come with extra benefits like research opportunities or leadership programs. They're competitive and prestigious. External scholarships come from organizations outside the school. Professional associations, diversity organizations, employers, and foundations. These require separate applications but stack on top of school-based aid.

          2:15 - 3:30 | What makes you scholarship-competitive? High test scores are a major factor. Professional achievements and leadership signal potential. Diversity of background helps schools build a well-rounded class. Fit with school priorities matters because schools invest strategically. And demonstrated interest is key. Schools want to give money to students who will actually attend. Your application is your scholarship application. The same committee that admits you often decides on merit aid.

          3:35 - 5:30 | Four strategies. First, apply Round 1. This is when the most money is available. Second, maximize your test score. GMAT and GRE scores heavily influence merit decisions. A higher score can mean more money. Third, apply to schools where your profile exceeds their typical student. You're more likely to receive money where you're above average. Fourth, show genuine interest. Visit campus, engage with events, write compelling "why this school" essays. Schools want to give money to students who will attend.

        <aside class="notes">
          5:30 - 7:00 | Two more strategies. Fifth, apply for external scholarships. Most MBA applicants don't apply for enough of them. Organizations like Forte Foundation for women, the Consortium for underrepresented minorities, ROMBA for LGBTQ+ candidates, and Service to School for veterans all offer meaningful awards. Ask your employer too. Many companies sponsor MBA programs. Apply to at least 5-8. Sixth, apply for need-based aid if you qualify. The forms are tedious but the money is real. External scholarships stack on top of school aid.

A $50K scholarship at one school might be worth less than $30K at another if tuition and living costs differ. Calculate the full picture: tuition, fees, living expenses for two years, and lost income. Then compare career outcomes at each school for your target industry. If both schools lead to similar outcomes, the cheaper option is the smarter financial decision. Prestige alone is not worth six figures of additional debt.

          8:30 - 9:45 | If you're taking on debt, be strategic. First, maximize federal loans for better rates and repayment terms. Second, compare private lenders carefully for any remaining need. Third, budget wisely during school. Your student lifestyle shouldn't match your post-MBA aspirations. Fourth, plan for repayment before you borrow. Know what your monthly payments will be and how they fit your expected post-MBA income. A good rule of thumb: if total loans are less than your expected first-year salary, you're in manageable territory.

          9:45 - 10:30 | Key takeaways. Most MBA aid is merit-based, so your application is your scholarship application. Apply Round 1 for the most money. Test scores matter, consider retaking if you're near a threshold. Apply to schools where your profile exceeds the average. Research and apply for external scholarships. And always compare total cost and career outcomes, not just sticker price. Funding an MBA is a significant decision. Approach it strategically.
