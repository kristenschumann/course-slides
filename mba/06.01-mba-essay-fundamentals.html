        <aside class="notes">
          0:00 - 0:30 | I've reviewed thousands of MBA essays over the years, and the thing I always tell new clients is this: your GMAT proves you can do the work, your resume shows what you've done, but the essays are where they decide if they want you in the room. At those odds, your essays aren't a formality — they're the decision. Today I'm going to walk you through the fundamentals I come back to with every single client.

        <aside class="notes">
          0:30 - 1:30 | Let that sink in. Your GMAT is a number. Your GPA is a number. Your resume is a list. The essays are the only place where the committee hears your voice — the way you think, the choices you've made, and why you made them. Every piece of advice I'm going to give you today flows from this idea. If your essay reads like a resume in paragraph form, you've wasted the one opportunity to be a person in this process.

        <aside class="notes">
          1:30 - 2:30 | This is the single most important principle I teach. When I read a draft, the first thing I look for is whether there's one clear story or five competing ones. HBS gets roughly 8,000 applications for 943 spots. Readers are scanning hundreds of essays. The ones that stay with them — the ones they advocate for in committee — are the ones where one specific moment reveals something true about who you are. Not a list of achievements. A moment. We'll come back to this idea throughout the video.

          2:30 - 4:00 | Look at the difference. On the left, we have a perfectly accurate statement. But it reads like a resume bullet — they already have your resume. They know you managed a team. What they don't know is what you did at 11 PM on that Thursday when the project was going sideways. The opening on the right puts the reader in the room with you. It creates tension. It makes them want to know what happened next. That's the difference between an essay that gets skimmed and one that gets remembered. Every one of my clients starts with something like the left. Our job together is to find the moment underneath it — the real story.

          4:00 - 5:30 | Three things. Every great essay I've read has these three things. First, a specific moment. Not "during my time at McKinsey." Give the reader a date, a room, a decision point. Ground them in reality. Second, a real decision. Not just what happened — what did you choose? And what did you give up by choosing it? That's where your judgment shows. Third — and this is where most essays fall short — what it changed in you. I don't mean the business outcome. I mean: how did this experience change how you think? How you lead? How you see the world? That's what Stanford is asking with "what matters most." That's what HBS is asking with "growth."

          5:30 - 7:30 | Let me show you what this looks like in practice. This is a fictional opening, but it's built from patterns I see in essays that work. The green highlight is the hook — "The call came at 6 AM on a Tuesday." Seven words. You're already in the story. You want to know what the call was about. Then the stakes — in red. The candidate disagrees with their manager. This is where judgment shows. They didn't just follow orders. They had a point of view and they acted on it. And finally, the turn — in blue. The reflection. Not "I saved the deal and got promoted." Instead: "It taught me that the hardest leadership moments are about showing up before you feel ready." That's the kind of insight that makes a committee member write "admit" on their scorecard.

          7:30 - 8:30 | This is the practical advice I give every client before they write a single word. Write your ending first. The ending is the point. It's the "so what." If you can't state it in one sentence — the one thing you want the reader to take away — then you haven't thought deeply enough yet. Go back to reflection. Talk to someone. Journal. But don't start drafting. I've seen clients spend weeks on drafts that wandered because they started writing before they knew where they were going. The ending is the compass.

"I called a meeting because our teams hadn't talked in three months." You can see this person. You can imagine being in that meeting. My test: read your essay aloud to a friend. If any sentence makes you cringe or sounds like a corporate memo, rewrite it. Your voice — your real voice, imperfections included — is what makes an essay genuine. That's especially important now that committees are looking for AI-generated patterns.

          9:30 - 11:30 | Three mistakes I see every cycle. First, listing achievements instead of showing judgment. "I delivered a $5M project on time and under budget." Great — that's your resume. What the committee wants to know is: what did you decide? What trade-off did you make? What did you learn when things didn't go as planned? Second, submitting the same essay everywhere. I can't say this enough. HBS, Stanford, and Wharton are evaluating different things. An essay that works for Stanford's "what matters most" will fail at HBS, which wants business-mindedness. You need to research each school's criteria. Third — and this one surprises people — polishing until your voice disappears. I've seen clients revise ten times and the essay gets worse. The seventh draft sounds corporate. Keep the version that sounds like you.

          11:30 - 12:30 | Three things to take away from this video. One: your essays are the only place in the application where you get to be a person. Your scores, your GPA, your resume — those are all data. The essay is your voice. Don't waste it by writing another resume in paragraph form. Two: one story, told deeply. Commit to a specific moment. Don't hedge by mentioning everything you've done. Three: write your ending first. The ending is the point. If you can't say it in one sentence, you need more reflection time, not more writing time. In the next video, we'll dig into school-specific strategies — what HBS, Stanford, and Wharton are actually looking for, and how to tailor your approach for each.
