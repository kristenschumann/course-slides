          0:00 - 0:30 | Here's the thing about MBA essays: your GMAT proves you can do the work, your resume shows what you've done, but the essays are where the committee decides if they want you in the room. I've worked with 300+ applicants who got into M7 programs, and the fundamentals I'm about to walk you through are what I come back to with every single one. This isn't theory. This is the stuff that moves the needle.

          0:45 - 2:15 | Three things. I tell every client this on our first call. Less than 1% of applicants nail all three in a single essay. Most people get one: they show what drives them, or they list their impact, or they talk about contribution. The ones who get into Stanford, HBS, Wharton? They find a way to weave all three into a single narrative. Think of it as a Venn diagram: your values, your contribution, your impact. The sweet spot is where all three overlap. That's your essay.

          2:30 - 4:30 | Step one: bring people into your world. I don't want "I grew up in a diverse environment." I want the fluorescent lights in the hospital waiting room. I want the sound of your mother's pen on the clipboard. Put me there. Step two: write how you speak. Read your draft aloud. If it sounds like a LinkedIn post, rewrite it. "Henceforth" is not how you talk to your friends. "Thus" is not how you tell a story. Step three: reflect. This is what separates a good essay from a great one. Don't just tell me what happened. Tell me what you took from it. How did it shift the way you see the world? Stanford calls this "what matters most." HBS calls it "growth." Every school is asking the same question in different words.

          4:30 - 5:30 | This is the single most important sentence in this entire video. Write like you're writing to a close friend. Not your boss. Not a committee. A friend. Someone who already knows you're smart, already knows your resume, and just wants to hear the real version. The moment you start writing for an imagined audience, trying to sound impressive, trying to hit the "right" keywords, you lose the thing that makes your essay yours. Put aside what you think they want to see. Show them who you are.

          5:30 - 6:30 | Here's what I mean. The left side? That could have been written by anyone. Or by ChatGPT. "Leveraged cross-functional synergies," no one talks like that. The right side? That's a person. You can see them. You can imagine being in that meeting. Here's my test: read your essay aloud to a friend. If any sentence makes you cringe, rewrite it. If it sounds like a corporate memo, rewrite it. Your voice, imperfections included, is the point. And I'll say this now: admissions committees are getting better at spotting AI-generated text. Your real voice is your best defense.

          6:45 - 8:30 | This is adapted from a Stanford GSB "What matters most" essay. Look at the green highlight, the hook. "The fluorescent lights in the hospital waiting room made everything look slightly green." Twelve words and you're in the room. You can see the lights. You can feel the plastic chair. That's what "bring people into your world" means. Now the red, the stakes. The mother is doing math in the margins of insurance paperwork. The family restaurant, three months without income. You feel the weight of it. And the blue, the turn. Not "I learned resilience." Not "this experience taught me the value of hard work." Instead: "I wanted to build systems so that no family has to do arithmetic in a hospital waiting room." That's a specific, forward-looking insight. It doesn't matter if you like the essay. What matters is understanding why it works.

          8:30 - 10:00 | Same applicant. Same story. Completely different impact. The early draft is a thesis statement: "What matters most to me is resilience." It then lists three examples in rapid succession. The committee finishes it and knows the applicant's argument but nothing about the applicant as a person. The evolved draft? You're in the waiting room. You can see the pen moving across the margins. That's the difference between telling someone your point and building a world they can step into. I see this with every client. First draft is always a thesis. My job is to find the scene underneath it. Your job is to do the same thing before you submit.

          10:00 - 10:45 | I need to say this directly. Every admissions office I've spoken to in the past year has mentioned AI-generated essays. They can tell. The writing is too smooth, too generic, too perfectly structured. It reads like a very competent stranger wrote it, because a very competent stranger did. Use AI for spell-check. Use it to catch typos. But the essay itself has to be yours. Your awkward phrasing, your specific references, your voice. That's what they're evaluating. If you hand that over to a tool, you've given away the one thing that makes your application different from the other 7,999.

          10:45 - 12:30 | Three mistakes I see every single cycle. First: listing achievements instead of showing judgment. "I delivered a $5M project on time and under budget." That's your resume. What the committee wants to know is: what did you decide? What trade-off did you make? What did you learn when it went sideways? Second: submitting the same essay everywhere. I can't say this enough. HBS wants business-mindedness and leadership under pressure. Stanford wants your core values. Wharton wants to see how you'll contribute to the community. Booth wants intellectual curiosity. An essay that works for one will fail at another. You need to research each school's criteria and tailor your approach. Third, and this one surprises people, polishing until your voice disappears. I've seen clients revise ten times and the essay gets worse. The seventh draft sounds corporate. The third draft sounded like them. Keep the version that sounds like you.

          12:30 - 13:30 | Three things to walk away with. One: your essays are the only place in the application where you get to be a person. Your GMAT is a number. Your GPA is a number. Your resume is a list. The essay is where the committee hears your voice. Don't waste it writing another resume in paragraph form. Two: write like you're talking to a close friend. That means specific moments, not general claims. The fluorescent lights, the meeting you called, the conversation with your mother. Put me there. Three: reflect before you draft. Write your ending first. If you can't state the point of your essay in one sentence, you need more thinking time, not more writing time. In the next video, we'll dig into school-specific strategies, what HBS, Stanford, Wharton, and Booth are each looking for, and how to tailor your approach.
