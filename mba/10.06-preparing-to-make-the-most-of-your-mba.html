Finance fundamentals: time value of money, NPV, IRR. Damodaran's free NYU lectures are exceptional. But your school's pre-term materials are the highest priority.

Don't stress if you're not a natural networker. You'll meet plenty of people during orientation.

          8:30 - 9:45 | A few final tips. Talk to second-year students and ask what they wish they'd done before starting. Familiarize yourself with courses, professors, and clubs so you can make better early decisions. If you're targeting consulting, banking, or tech, understand the recruiting timeline. These processes start very early. If considering a deferral, contact admissions early as policies vary. And seriously, relax. You'll work hard for two years. Use this time to recharge.
