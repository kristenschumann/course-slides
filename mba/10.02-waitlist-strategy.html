          1:00 - 2:15 | Why do schools waitlist? They can't perfectly predict yield, so they use waitlists to fill the class. Being waitlisted means you were competitive. The committee saw potential, otherwise they would have rejected you. The odds vary widely by school and year. Some pull heavily from waitlists, others barely touch them. Research your school's history to calibrate expectations.

          7:30 - 9:00 | Waitlists create complicated decisions. If you have an admit elsewhere, deposit at your backup. This is normal. Schools expect it. Ask the waitlist school if they can share timing guidance, especially if you have deadlines at other schools. Be honest throughout the process. And most importantly, protect yourself. Never turn down a solid admit hoping for a waitlist miracle. Always have a backup you'd be happy attending.

Withdraw from other schools promptly and professionally. If not admitted, remember it's not a failure. Sometimes the math doesn't work out.

And if you have no admits this cycle, evaluate whether to strengthen your profile and reapply.

Share meaningful updates every 4-6 weeks, but only when you have real news. Protect yourself by depositing at backup schools. If you're eventually admitted, respond fast. And if it doesn't work out, know that it's not a failure. You can reapply next year with a stronger profile. Waitlists are uncertain, but you can handle them strategically.
