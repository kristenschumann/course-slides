          0:00 - 0:30 | Here's something that trips up many applicants: they finish their essay draft and think they're done. They proofread for typos, make a few tweaks, and submit. But the best essays aren't written, they're rewritten. The difference between a good essay and a great one often comes down to revision.

          1:00 - 2:00 | First, the right mindset. Your first draft is not supposed to be good. Its job is to exist. The goal of drafting is to get ideas on paper. The goal of revision is to shape those ideas into something compelling. This means you should expect to revise multiple times. Professional writers revise relentlessly, and your MBA essays deserve the same treatment. Three key principles: give yourself time between drafts, at least a day. What seemed brilliant at 2 AM often looks different in the morning. Read with the committee's perspective, they don't know you and they're reading cold. And be willing to cut. Sometimes the best revision is removing a paragraph that doesn't serve the essay.

          2:00 - 3:30 | Five specific techniques for revising your own work. Read aloud: when you read in your head, your brain fills in gaps and smooths over awkward phrasing. When you read aloud, you hear the problems. If a sentence sounds clunky spoken, rewrite it. Print it out: there's something about paper that makes errors more visible. Grab a pen and mark it up. Change the format: read your essay in a different font, on your phone, or as a PDF. The visual change helps your brain see it fresh. Read backward: go paragraph by paragraph in reverse order. This breaks the flow and forces you to evaluate each section independently. And the "so what?" test: after each paragraph, ask "so what? why does this matter?" If you can't answer, the paragraph isn't doing enough work.

          3:30 - 5:00 | Each revision pass should focus on different things. Don't try to fix everything at once. Pass 1, big picture: does the essay answer the prompt? Is there a clear arc? Does the ending land? Pass 2, content: is every paragraph necessary? Are there specific details and examples? Are you going deep enough? Pass 3, flow: do paragraphs connect smoothly? Is the pacing right, not too rushed, not too slow? Pass 4, voice and tone: does this sound like you? Is the tone appropriate? Anything generic? Pass 5, line editing: sentence-level clarity, word choice, removing filler. And pass 6 is proofreading, spelling, grammar, punctuation. Don't skip to proofreading until the content is solid. There's no point in perfecting the grammar of a paragraph you might cut.

People with MBA experience if available. And people who don't know you, because they'll react the way an admissions officer would. Be specific about what kind of feedback you need. "What do you think?" is too vague. Instead ask: does this answer the prompt fully? What's the one thing you remember after reading it? Is there anything confusing? Does this sound like me? Where did your attention drift? What questions are left unanswered? These targeted questions get you actionable feedback instead of vague praise.

          6:30 - 7:45 | Not all feedback is equal. Three rules for using it well. Look for patterns: if multiple people flag the same issue, it's probably a real problem. If only one person has a concern, it might just be their preference. Feedback tells you what isn't working, but how you fix it is up to you. If someone says a paragraph is confusing, you don't have to use their suggested rewrite, you just need to fix the confusion. Protect your voice: if feedback pushes you toward something that doesn't feel like you, push back. Writing something inauthentic to please a reviewer won't work. And know when to stop: at some point, more feedback creates diminishing returns. If the essay is solid after multiple rounds, stop revising and submit.

          7:45 - 8:45 | Here's a realistic timeline. Draft 1: get everything on paper. Don't edit yet. Then wait 1-2 days. Revision 1: big picture and content. Does this work? Then share with 2-3 people and collect feedback over a few days. Revision 2: address feedback, improve structure and depth. Share again with 1-2 people, same or different. Revision 3: flow, voice, and line editing. Final proofread. This process takes 2-4 weeks per essay. If you're applying to multiple schools, you need to factor that timeline into your application plan. Start early.

          8:45 - 9:30 | Four common revision traps. Revising while drafting: write first, revise later. If you try to perfect each sentence while drafting, you'll never finish. Asking too many people: five opinions are more useful than fifteen. Too much feedback creates confusion. Only seeking validation: if you only show your essay to people who will tell you it's great, you won't improve it. Seek out honest, critical readers. And skipping the break between drafts: fresh eyes are essential. Don't revise when you're still attached to what you just wrote. Give yourself at least a day between major revision rounds.

Use different revision passes for different levels, from big picture down to proofreading. Get external feedback from varied sources with specific questions, not just "what do you think?" Look for patterns in feedback and protect your authentic voice. If it doesn't sound like you, revert. And know when to stop. Perfect is the enemy of done. Revision is where good essays become great. Invest the time.
