        <aside class="notes">
          0:00 - 0:30 | Here is something that trips up a lot of MBA applicants: you need clear career goals to get into business school, but the whole point of business school is often to figure out what you want to do. Schools do not expect you to have everything figured out, but they do want to see that you have thought seriously about your direction.

          1:00 - 2:15 | Admissions committees are trying to answer one question: will this person succeed? Your career goals help them assess three things. First, fit: does this person know what they want, and does our program help them get there? If you want to break into tech and you are applying to a school known for finance, that is a mismatch. Second, trajectory: is this person thinking clearly about their future? Vague goals suggest vague thinking. Third, contribution: what will this person bring to the community? Clear direction means you can contribute to recruiting events, clubs, and classroom discussions from day one.

Specific: not "I want to work in consulting" but "I want to join a strategy consulting firm like Bain or McKinsey, focusing on healthcare clients." Realistic: the goal needs to be achievable given your background plus the MBA. Logical: it should connect to your past experiences with a clear thread. And exciting: show ambition, show the impact you want to have.

Maybe you want to lead a division, launch a startup, or shape policy. It should be connected, a logical extension of your short-term goal. If your short-term is healthcare consulting, your long-term might be COO of a health system. It should be impactful, showing you want to make a difference. And it should be authentic, because goals you genuinely care about come through in your writing and interviews. Borrowed goals never work.

          7:00 - 8:15 | Let us address some common misconceptions. First, your goals do not have to be set in stone. Schools know plans change. They want to see that you can articulate a direction. Second, do not say what you think they want to hear. If you are not genuinely interested, it shows. Third, more specific is not always better. There is a balance between "Head of Product at Spotify" and "I want to work in tech." Fourth, you do not need unique goals. Many people want consulting or banking, and that is fine. What differentiates you is why you want that path. Fifth, traditional career goals are not always safe. If your target industry is being reshaped by AI, acknowledging that transformation shows you are thinking forward.

          8:15 - 9:15 | Here are goals that raise concerns. Goals that do not require an MBA. If you can achieve your objectives without business school, why invest two years and $100K to $300K in tuition? Frame the MBA as a necessary accelerant. Goals disconnected from your background. Random pivots without explanation are not compelling. Goals that are too vague. "I want to be a leader" says nothing. Goals that are unrealistically specific. "CEO of Apple by 2035" is not credible. And goals that are only about money. "Maximize earning potential" may be true, but it is not what you should lead with.

          9:15 - 10:00 | Five things to remember. Specificity matters: name the industry, function, and type of company. Connection matters: your goals should link to your past. Credibility matters: the path from here to there should make sense. Authenticity matters: you have to actually care about this direction. And evolution is okay: your goals can and probably will change. The goal is not to have a perfect 10-year plan. It is to demonstrate that you think seriously about your future and know how to chart a course.
