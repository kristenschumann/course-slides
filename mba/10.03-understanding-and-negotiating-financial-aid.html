        <aside class="notes">
          0:00 - 0:30 | Financial aid at business school is often negotiable. Not at every school, and not in every situation, but if you have multiple offers in hand, you may be able to significantly reduce your total cost. The difference between someone who negotiates and someone who doesn't can easily be $30,000 to $50,000 or more.

          1:00 - 2:30 | There are two fundamentally different systems. Merit-based aid is awarded based on your application strength. You don't apply separately. The amount reflects how much the school wants you. Most T15 schools use this. Need-based aid is determined entirely by your finances. Your application quality has no bearing on the amount. Harvard and Stanford use this model, where roughly 50% of students receive fellowships. Some schools like Columbia and Yale offer both types.

        <aside class="notes">
          2:35 - 4:00 | Three factors make negotiation likely to succeed. First, you need a competing offer from a peer-ranked school. This is the single most important factor. If Booth offers you $40K and Kellogg offers $70K, Booth has a reason to reconsider. Second, the competing school needs to be a genuine peer. Schools understand their competitive set and respond to peer pressure, not offers from schools they don't consider competitors. Third, increasing an existing award is much easier than creating a new one. If you weren't offered money at admission, it's rarely given after the fact.

Attach documentation. Don't threaten. Don't overexplain. Most schools respond within one to two weeks. The outcome will be an increased offer, a polite decline, or a request for more information. If they decline, accept it gracefully. Pushing harder rarely works and can damage the relationship.

          8:20 - 10:00 | Don't compare tuition numbers. Compare total cost of attendance. That means tuition and fees for 2 years after scholarships, living expenses which vary enormously by location, your loan burden (a good rule of thumb is that total loans below your expected first-year salary are manageable), and career ROI. Compare median salaries in your target industry at each school. A school that costs $40K more but places 30% of graduates in your target industry at higher salary may have better ROI. But if both schools lead to similar outcomes, the cheaper option is the smarter financial decision.

          10:00 - 10:45 | Key takeaways. Merit-based aid is negotiable. Need-based aid at HBS and Stanford is not. You need a competing peer-school offer as your strongest basis. Frame it as a tough personal decision, not leverage. Keep the email under 200 words. Compare total cost of attendance, not just tuition. And if the answer is no, accept it gracefully. Financial aid negotiation isn't about being clever. It's about being honest about your situation and asking a reasonable question.
