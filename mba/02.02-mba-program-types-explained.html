          1:15 - 2:45 | The three main paths. Full-time is two years of full immersion. You leave your job and go all in. Ideal if you have 3 to 7 years of experience and want to make a significant career change. You get full recruiting access, an internship between years, and over 90% of scholarships go to full-time students. Part-time programs are evenings and weekends, lasting up to five years. You keep your job and salary. Best if you want to advance within your current company or industry, not pivot entirely. Application growth for part-time programs has actually outpaced full-time recently. Executive MBA is 18 to 24 months of intensive modules. Designed for people with 10 or more years of experience who are already in or near leadership roles. 69% of EMBA applicants have 10-plus years of experience. Employers frequently sponsor tuition.

          2:45 - 4:15 | Here is a quick comparison of all seven formats. Full-time is two years, you stop working, ideal for career changers. Part-time runs 2.5 to 5 years, you keep your job, great for advancing. Executive is 18 to 24 months, you keep working, designed for senior leaders. Online offers maximum flexibility, you work from anywhere. Deferred enrollment means you apply as a student and defer for 2 to 5 years while gaining experience. Specialized programs focus on a single industry or function like tech or healthcare. And dual degrees combine an MBA with another graduate degree like law or medicine, typically 3 to 5 years total.

          4:15 - 5:30 | Let's go deeper on full-time. The investment is significant. Total cost at a top program runs $100K to $300K depending on school, location, and living expenses, and that includes foregone salary. But over 90% of scholarships go to full-time students, so the net cost can be much lower. Stanford GSB offers 120+ electives, 9 core courses, and a global experience requirement. That depth is hard to match in other formats. The internship between years is a major advantage: it often leads directly to your full-time offer. Choose full-time if you want to change careers, need recruiting access, and can financially manage the two-year commitment.

          5:30 - 7:15 | Part-time versus executive. Part-time works best with 5 to 10 years of experience. No income gap, you keep your salary and benefits. At the end, you have the same degree as full-time students. Top programs offer 100+ electives, identical to full-time. If your employer pays, you might graduate debt-free. 56% of weekend programs and 60% of evening programs reported application growth recently. The tradeoff is a less immersive experience and a slower timeline. Executive MBA is for people with 10+ years already in or near leadership. Your classmates are VPs, directors, and C-suite leaders. The peer network alone can be transformative. GMAT is often waived for experienced candidates. Cost runs $150K to $220K+, but employer sponsorship is common. The tradeoff is the cost and the demanding schedule of intensive modules alongside your full-time job.

          7:20 - 9:30 | Four alternative formats. Online MBA offers maximum flexibility. Michigan Ross includes optional in-person residencies alongside fully online coursework. Many programs don't disclose online status on transcripts, the credential is the same. The concern that online MBAs don't count has largely faded. Deferred enrollment is newer. You apply as an undergraduate or master's student, get accepted, then defer 2 to 5 years while gaining experience. Northwestern Kellogg's Future Leaders Program requires no test scores. These are highly competitive with lower acceptance rates than regular programs. Specialized MBAs focus on industries like tech, healthcare, or finance. NYU Stern's Tech MBA is a one-year, STEM-designated program. Great if you have a clear industry focus. Dual degrees combine an MBA with law, medicine, or policy. Harvard offers JD/MBA, MD/MBA, MBA/MPP, and several MBA/MS combinations. Typically 3 to 5 years, shorter than pursuing degrees separately.

          9:30 - 10:45 | Four misconceptions to challenge. "Full-time is always the most prestigious." Prestige depends on the school, not the format. A part-time Booth MBA carries more weight than a full-time degree from a lower-ranked program. "Online MBAs don't count." Outdated. Top schools like Michigan Ross and Berkeley Haas offer strong online programs. Employers increasingly evaluate the school brand and your skills, not the delivery format. "EMBA is just for old people." It is for experienced people. You want to be in a classroom with peers at your level. And "specialized MBAs are too narrow." They are narrow by design. If you know your industry, that focus is an asset.

Moving into senior leadership points to EMBA. Locking in admission early means deferred. Deep industry expertise means specialized. Bridging multiple disciplines means dual degree. Then layer in your constraints. Cannot leave your job? Part-time, EMBA, or online. Cannot relocate? Online. Limited budget? Online or part-time with employer support. Employer willing to sponsor? Part-time or EMBA. Still a student? Deferred enrollment.

          12:00 - 13:00 | Experience level is another key factor. If you are a current student, deferred enrollment is your path. With 2 to 7 years of experience, full-time is the traditional choice, especially for career changers. Part-time also works here if you want to advance rather than pivot. At 7 to 10 years, part-time or EMBA both make sense depending on your seniority and goals. And at 10+ years, EMBA is designed specifically for you. Your learning style matters too. Want full immersion? Full-time. Need flexibility? Part-time, online, or EMBA. Are you a self-directed learner? Online may be ideal.
