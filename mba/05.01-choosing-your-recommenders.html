Having a clear strategy for who you select and how you empower them makes a significant difference.

          1:00 - 2:15 | There are six must-have requirements. First, your recommenders need to know you well enough to write specifically about your strengths. They should have worked with you closely and observed your professional performance firsthand. Second, at least one must be a direct manager or supervisor. This is especially important for HBS and GSB, who are specific about this. Third, your recommenders should complement each other but not overlap. They should come from different parts of your professional life so each letter brings something uniquely powerful.

          2:15 - 3:30 | Fourth, your recommenders need to be credible. This means professional standing, not personal connections. Alumni or MBA status is neither the only nor the best way to prove credibility. A recommender with personal, powerful stories about you is more important than having MBA after their name. Fifth, they need to understand what it takes to get into a top program. Even if they've never written a recommendation before, you can and should coach them. Sixth, your recommender needs to genuinely want you to succeed. When their incentives are aligned with yours, that's when the magic happens.

While professors can work if you've taken recent executive education, admissions committees are most interested in how you perform in a professional setting.

          4:45 - 6:00 | Here is the step-by-step process. First, make a list of every recommender who fits the criteria. Second, have initial conversations with your top 3-5 candidates. Reach out, share that you're applying, gauge their enthusiasm, and get a sense of whether they'd write a strong letter. Third, score each potential recommender on the six must-haves using a simple 1-3 scale. Fourth, overlay two strategic questions: do my top two recommenders cover different dimensions? And does either have a school tie that adds weight? This turns a gut decision into a structured one.

          7:00 - 8:15 | Look at the difference specificity makes. The weak version says Evelyn is mature and gets positive feedback. It's vague and forgettable. The strong version says her maturity exceeds much older colleagues, she got positive feedback across the broader company, and they extended an offer at a higher level than typical for new grads. Specific claims backed by evidence. The best recommendations use bold language and concrete stories. These schools are not in the business of accepting average people, so the recommendation should not describe you as average.

          8:15 - 9:15 | Here is the most important principle. Business schools try to trick recommenders into providing an objective evaluation, but that is not what you're asking for. You want your recommenders to be truthful, but you're drafting them onto your team. Great recommenders fully understand that, fight for you, and involve you throughout the process. And remember: how well your recommender knows you and the words they're willing to write is significantly more important than who they are. An alumni who barely knows you will never outperform a manager who can tell powerful stories about your work.

        <aside class="notes">
          9:15 - 9:45 | Think strategically about coverage. Ideally, have one recommender who speaks to your technical and functional excellence, one who covers your leadership and interpersonal skills, and one who can speak to your growth potential and future impact. Your creativity and thoughtfulness here will round out the rest of your application. Allow 3 to 4 months from first outreach to deadline. It can be done in two months, but we don't recommend less. Give recommenders at least a month from receiving prep materials to the due date, and six weeks if applying to three or more schools.

And draft your recommenders onto your team. Choose wisely and set them up for success.
