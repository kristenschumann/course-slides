        <aside class="notes">
          0:00 - 0:30 | The activities, interests, and awards section doesn't get as much attention as essays or test scores. It probably won't make or break your candidacy on its own. But it can reinforce your narrative, show dimensionality, and give the admissions committee a sense of who you are beyond work. Let me show you how to approach this section strategically.

          0:30 - 1:30 | Three reasons this section matters. First, it rounds out your story. Your essays and resume show your professional self. This section shows what you do with your time outside of work. Second, it supports your narrative. If your essays emphasize a passion, your activities should provide evidence. A disconnect here is a red flag. Third, it signals campus fit. Schools want students who will be involved on campus. If you've been active in undergrad or your community, that suggests you'll be involved in business school too.

        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-light" style="margin-top: 24px;">Cover 2-3 of these themes across your activity slots. Each entry should reveal something different about you.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          1:30 - 2:45 | Most applications give you limited slots with tight character limits. You can't include everything, so cover 2 to 3 of these themes. First, desire to give back through volunteering, nonprofit board membership, community organizing, or mentoring. Second, desire to be involved through professional associations, alumni groups, or campus activities. Third, diversity of perspective through unique hobbies, creative pursuits, athletic achievements, or cultural activities. Each slot should reveal something different about you that isn't shown elsewhere in the application.

          2:45 - 4:15 | Character limits are tight, so every word matters. Look at the difference between weak and strong descriptions. "Volunteer at local food bank" tells nothing. "Led 15 volunteers in redesigning distribution, reducing wait times 40%" shows leadership and quantified impact. The pattern is always the same: lead with what you accomplished, include numbers, skip obvious context, and use action verbs. Led, organized, launched, increased, developed. Draft in a separate document and edit ruthlessly before pasting into the application.

        <aside class="notes">
          4:15 - 5:30 | Awards stress people out. "I haven't won anything!" But awards and honors are broader than trophies. Start by making a big list of everything you're proud of: academic honors, work recognition, competition wins, certifications, anything selective. Then think about what each represents. The committee doesn't care about the award itself, they care what it says about you. Dean's list shows intellectual capability. A case competition win shows strategic thinking. Top performer at work shows high standards. Pick awards that represent different strengths. And don't leave it blank. Completing a marathon is an achievement. Getting into a competitive program is an achievement.

          5:30 - 6:30 | The interests portion is your chance to be memorable. Generic interests like reading, travel, and fitness tell nothing. Specific interests create conversation. "Completed 5 ultramarathons across 3 continents." "Building a YouTube channel about Korean street food with 15K subscribers." "Competitive amateur chess, rated 1800 FIDE." The pattern is always the same: turn a generic interest into a specific one. Instead of cooking, say hosting monthly dinners featuring cuisines from countries you've visited. Instead of fitness, say trained for and completed your first Olympic triathlon at age 35. But be honest. The point is to present what genuinely interests you in a compelling way, not to invent interests you don't have.

Disconnecting from your narrative, where your activities contradict what you say in essays. Listing activities without impact, like "member of marketing club" with no details. And padding with insignificant items. Three strong entries beat six weak ones every time. Also remember: being generic about interests is a missed opportunity. "Travel, reading, sports" is forgettable. Be specific.
