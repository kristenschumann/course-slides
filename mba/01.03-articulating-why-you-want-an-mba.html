          0:00 - 0:30 | This is the number one paradox I see in my coaching: you need clear career goals to get in, but most people are going to business school precisely because they are figuring things out. I have worked with hundreds of applicants on this, and the good news is schools get it. They do not expect a crystal ball. They want to see you have done the thinking.

          1:00 - 2:15 | From my experience sitting on the other side of this process, adcoms are really asking one question: will this person succeed? Your goals help them assess three things. Fit: do you know what you want, and can our program get you there? I have seen strong applicants get dinged because they wanted tech but applied to a finance-heavy school. Trajectory: are you thinking clearly? Vague goals signal vague thinking, and adcoms pick up on that fast. Contribution: what do you bring from day one? When you have direction, you show up to clubs, recruiting panels, and classroom discussions with purpose.

          2:15 - 3:30 | Your short-term goal is the first 3 to 5 years post-MBA. When I work with clients, I push for four qualities. Specific: not "I want to work in consulting" but "I want to join a strategy consulting firm like Bain or McKinsey, focusing on healthcare clients." Realistic: achievable given your background plus the MBA. Logical: there should be a clear thread connecting your past to this next step. And exciting: show ambition. I want to feel your energy when you talk about this direction.

          4:30 - 5:30 | The long-term goal is your 10+ year vision, and this is where I tell clients to dream bigger. Visionary: lead a division, launch a company, shape policy. Connected: it should be a logical extension of your short-term. If short-term is healthcare consulting, long-term might be COO of a health system. Impactful: show you want to make a difference beyond your own career. And authentic: this is huge. 💡 Share an example of a client whose genuine passion came through vs. one who borrowed goals and how the difference showed up in essays and interviews. Goals you actually care about are magnetic on the page. Borrowed goals fall flat every time.

What problems keep you up at night? Step 2, research. I have clients study LinkedIn profiles of people 5 and 10 years ahead. Search your target role, filter by education, notice patterns. Step 3, find the thread. What recurring themes show up across your work and interests? This is where the narrative comes together. Step 4, test for fit. Is an MBA genuinely the best path? Does this specific school help? And Step 5, be willing to evolve. Your goals do not have to be perfect. They have to be thoughtful. I tell every client: many of my former clients changed plans during business school, and they are thriving.

          7:00 - 8:15 | These are misconceptions I correct constantly in my coaching. "My goals must be set in stone." No. Schools know plans change. They want thoughtful direction. "Say what they want to hear." I cannot stress this enough: inauthenticity shows. Adcoms read thousands of essays and they can spot borrowed goals immediately. "More specific is always better." There is a sweet spot. "Head of Product at Spotify" is too narrow. "I want to work in tech" is too vague. Aim for the middle. "I need unique goals." Consulting and banking are totally fine. What differentiates you is your why. And "traditional goals are always safe." If your target industry is being reshaped by AI, acknowledge it. That shows forward thinking.

          8:15 - 9:15 | These are the red flags I watch for. 💡 Share a story about a client who came in with red-flag goals and how you worked together to fix them. Goals that do not require an MBA: if you can get there without business school, why invest $100K to $300K? I always push clients to frame the MBA as a necessary accelerant. Disconnected goals: random pivots without a narrative are not compelling to adcoms. Too vague: "I want to be a leader" tells them nothing. Unrealistically specific: "CEO of Apple by 2035" is not credible. And money-only goals: "maximize earning potential" may be honest, but it should never be your lead.

          9:15 - 10:00 | Here is what I want you to take away from my coaching on this. Specificity: name the industry, function, and company type. Connection: link your goals to your past. Credibility: the path from here to there has to make sense. Authenticity: you have to actually care about this direction, and trust me, it shows when you do. And evolution is okay. Your goals will probably change, and that is perfectly fine. What I tell every client: you are not writing a prediction. You are demonstrating that you think seriously about your future and can chart a course. That is what gets you in.
