        <aside class="notes">
          0:00 - 0:30 | Career goals essays seem straightforward: tell us what you want to do. But they trip up applicants constantly. Either the goals are too vague, they don't connect to the background, or the "why MBA?" feels forced. This essay is your chance to show that you've thought seriously about your future and that an MBA is the logical next step.

          1:00 - 2:30 | Five things schools evaluate. Clarity: can you articulate a clear direction? Vague goals suggest vague thinking. Logic: do your goals connect to your background? A marketing person wanting healthcare consulting needs to explain the thread. Credibility: are your goals realistic? Ambitious but achievable. Need for MBA: is the MBA actually necessary? You need to show why the MBA specifically enables your path. Fit: do your goals align with what this school offers? If you want tech and you're applying to a finance school, explain the fit.

          2:30 - 4:00 | Let me show you the difference between vague and compelling goals. Vague: "I want to work in technology." This tells the reader nothing. Better: "I want a product management role at a consumer tech company." Now they can picture it. Compelling: "I want a PM role at a high-growth consumer tech company like Airbnb or Stripe, focusing on growth initiatives, combining my engineering background with business strategy." Now the reader sees the full picture. Your short-term goal should answer four questions: what function, what industry, what type of company, and what will you be doing day-to-day? Long-term goals can be broader but should flow logically from your short-term.

On the right, strong reasons that connect to specific gaps. "I need financial modeling skills to evaluate acquisition targets." "Consulting recruiting requires structured MBA access." "The MBA bridges my credibility gap for an industry pivot." Notice the pattern: strong reasons connect to specific skill gaps, specific access needs, or specific credibility bridges. Generic reasons don't work.

          7:00 - 8:30 | The best career goals essays create a coherent narrative. Past: here's where I come from. Here are the experiences that shaped my interests. Present: here's where I am now. Here's what I've learned, and here's why I'm ready for a transition. MBA: here's how the degree bridges the gap. Future: here's where I'm going and the impact I want to have. When this arc works, the reader thinks: "Of course this person wants to do that. It makes perfect sense." Each element connects. Past informs present. Present motivates future. The MBA bridges the gap.

          8:30 - 9:30 | Here's a structure that works. Open with something engaging, a moment or realization, then state your short-term goal clearly. Next, briefly explain how your past led you here. This establishes credibility. Then explain specifically why you need the MBA. What will it give you that you don't have? Share your long-term vision and connect it to impact. If the prompt asks, explain why this school specifically. Many schools give you 300 to 500 words. That's tight. Every sentence must earn its place. Cut generic statements, obvious facts, backstory that doesn't connect, and anything you say elsewhere in the application.

          9:30 - 10:45 | Three common errors. Goals too vague: "I want to make an impact in healthcare" tells the reader nothing. What specifically do you want to do? Disconnected arc: if your essay could be written by anyone, it's missing the "you." Why do your experiences make these your goals? No "why MBA?" logic: if the reader can't understand why you need an MBA specifically, and why you can't just get promoted or take a course, the essay fails its core purpose.
